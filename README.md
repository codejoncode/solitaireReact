This is my implementation of the popular gmae solitaire.  The purpose of this creation is to go over my web development skills, test my ability to solve problems and have some fun along the way.  When I think about solitaire games that I have played in the past I remember clicking and dragging items. I think about how I may implement this. I also try to consider how I would implement the stacking of the cards on top of each other. Of course some of these ideas I wonder if I can implement but then I also want to answer the question with a yes. So I will get started. I also plan to write a medium blog post to accompany this project. 

A couple steps to begin will be  to create the playing cards themselves, build the layout of where the cards will be on the screen. I don't want to use images for the cards but create my own card. I consider this project to be the begining of a bigger project where I will need to design the cards (for a different game) so I kind of believe that this project like a step in a marathon.
